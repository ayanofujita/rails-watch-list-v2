# ðŸ“š Movie Watchlist version 2

A web application that allows users to create, manage, and share personalized movie lists. It builds upon the original version, which was created as part of my Le Wagon bootcamp. Version 2 introduces several key features that were not present in Version 1:

- **User sign-in**: Each user can create an account and log in to access their personal watchlists and reviews.
- **Wider movie collection**: Integration with the OMDB API allows users to search for movies from a much larger selection.
- **Sorting by popularity**: Users can sort their movie lists based on movie popularity.
- **Saving other users' watchlists**: Users can now save other people's movie lists to their own account.
- **Responsiveness**: The app is fully responsive, ensuring a smooth and consistent experience across multiple devices.
